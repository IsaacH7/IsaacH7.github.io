# Dataset 
The data set I took interest in is the consumption of energy around the world. Due to how the effects of climate change has brought upon the world, clean and reusable energy has become more and more important. This dataset shows the types of energy being consumed, as well as showing how the world is sharing energy. This data set could be applicable when it comes to researching which country is consuming the most energy as well as the type of energy they are consuming the most, which in turn allows users to analyze cleaner and reusable energy solutions to that country.

The Data science book I have chosen and interests me is *Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything* by Jeffrey Needham. The reason this book interested me was due to how the book breaks down Big Data, explaining the idea of Big Data, why it's so important, and how companies who are Big Data Driven are outcompeteing companies who are not. *Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything* also closely explains how Big Data is beneficial as well issues it may have. This book explains and breaks down Big Data and Business as well as how much of a neccessity Big Data is to businesses.
